 ## Fourier coefficient behaviour in Gaussian Boson Sampling
 `report.pdf`
 
  Honours dissertation for the final year project of my BSc in Physics and Computer Science. The project involved calculating and analysing the behaviour of the Fourier coefficients of the probability distributions of outcomes of simulated    Gaussian Boson Sampling experiments to verify the claims of quantum advantage that have been boasted in relation to this specific computation. Supervised by Raúl García-Patrón Sánchez.
  Recieved a grade of 90.
