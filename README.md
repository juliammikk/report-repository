This repository collects papers I have written in the past couple of years.

 
 ## Fourier coefficient behaviour in Gaussian Boson Sampling
 `honours-disseration.pdf` *- April 2024*

  Honours dissertation for the final year project of my BSc in Physics and Computer Science; supervised by Dr. Raúl García-Patrón Sánchez. The project involved calculating and analysing the behaviour of the Fourier coefficients of the probability distributions of outcomes of simulated Gaussian Boson Sampling experiments to verify the claims of quantum advantage that have been boasted in relation to this specific computation. (grade awarded: 90%)

 ## Searches for diboson resonances at the LHC
 `gravitational-waves-history.pdf` *- March 2024*

  A literature review on the searches for BSM (Beyond the Standard Model) diboson resonances at the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC. 
  Covers the BSM theories that could produce these resonances, the methodology of the searches and the results so far. 
   
 ## Surfing through the history of gravitational waves
 `gravitational-waves-history.pdf` *- November 2022*

  A report on the events that lead to discovery of gravitational waves from a scientific point of view.
